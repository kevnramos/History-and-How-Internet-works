                <ul>

                    <li> The invention of the internet completely altered the trajectory of the human race, “it is on
                        par with the wheel, fire, language, the printing press.” From a computer as big as a room to
                        millions and millions of websites and computers connected around the world. In short, the
                        internet was born from a domino effect created by the space race between the Soviets and the
                        United States.
                    </li>
                    <br>

                    <li> Dwight D. Eisenhower created ARPA in 1958, the Advanced Research Projects Agency to keep up
                        with the Soviets. NASA later stepped up to the plate, but the creation of ARPA helped deploy the
                        first bare-bones internet in 1969. At first, it was to reduce redundancy, instead of opening up
                        three terminals to work on three computers, it was better to open up just one terminal to talk
                        to all three computers.
                    </li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Many graduates students, and researchers, and of course, ARPA wanted to create a network that
                        would allow communication between computers in different places. The big challenge was how
                        information should be sent over the network of computers. Paul Baran came up with the idea of
                        breaking up the information into small packets that would be sent across different nodes of
                        computers. Each packet contained information like where it came from, what it contained, and
                        where it was going. At first, computers were only able to communicate between other computers on
                        the same protocol, and this made communication between computers extremely tedious.

                <ul>

                    <li>The first-ever form of the internet was a network established between a couple of universities
                        across the United States, called the ARPA network. Leonard Kleinrock, an MIT grad student
                        applied the queuing theory on data transmission, and it is what the ARPA network used. Queuing
                        theory is simply a system in which something arrives somewhere, then goes on to the next
                        destination, similar to an envelope in the mail, which goes through different post offices until
                        it reaches its destination.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>This data transmission was implemented using the demand access
                        technique and distributed control. This meant that data was only sent through nodes depending on
                        how urgent it was, and no node had supreme control over the entire network.
