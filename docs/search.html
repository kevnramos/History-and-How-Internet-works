                <ul>

                    <li> When the word wide web was just an infant, there was no way of typing something into a search
                        bar and getting relevant information. You would have to traverse the web by continuously
                        clicking links until you arrived at what you were looking for, making the world wide web utterly
                        useless. But along came some great minds from Stanford University that completely changed the
                        internet forever.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> To start, two Stanford University students, David Filo and Jerry Yang were one day scouring the
                        internet looking for relevant information on sports for their fantasy basketball team. They came
                        across the idea that the internet should be easily searchable. They launched their website Yahoo
                        that simply broke the internet into categories, and they spent hours looking at websites
                        choosing in which category they belonged to. This caught the attention of some venture
                        capitalists, because Yahoo was getting lots of traffic to their site. Venture CApitalists
                        obviously want to make money, so they urged Yahoo to put advertisements on their page. The
                        founders were skeptical at first, so they tested it out with small banner ads. Their users did
                        not complain so they put out even more advertisements. Yahoo was also competing with another
                        website called Excite. The competition was fierce. If one company released a feature, so did the
                        other. Those companies soon lost sight of why they were created in the first place, as a search
                        engine. Their searching capabilities were poor because they just showed websites that matched
                        specific words.

                <ul>

                    <li>Along came Larry Page and Sergey Brin, students also from Stanford University. they came up
                        with a clever way to search the internet. They figured that if a specific webpage with specific
                        keywords was linked to other websites, it meant that the page in question was relevant. The more
                        websites pointed to another, the more relevant it became. This made results while searching the
                        internet far more relevant. They soon began looking for an investment to keep their startup
                        going. They asked many venture capitalists, and many turned them down. They didn't want to
                        invest in another search engine that did the same thing, they missed out on an investment of a
                        lifetime. While Larry Page and Sergey Brin were looking for investments, they had a meeting with
                        a rival search engine, Excite. Google offered Excite the entire company for a measly 1 million
                        dollars! Google as of February 2021 is worth almost 1.4 trillion dollars.

                    <br>
                    <li>Google, after securing small investments from many investors, they began to grow rapidly. Not
                        only did Google offer relevant search results, they also offered relevant advertisements. This
                        completely changed the internet forever, while also making it highly profitable. Google takes
                        part in my everyday life from its calendar, to its email service, and most importantly its
                        search engine.
