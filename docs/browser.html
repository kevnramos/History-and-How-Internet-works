                    <li> Back in the early 1990s the world wide web, created by Tim Berners Lee was just a collection of
                        webpages that contained nothing but line after line of text. There was also no way to find
                        something easily, and the web was mostly used by scientists and researchers. This inspired Mark
                        Andreessen, a student from the University of Illinois, to create a web browser that could be
                        used by the general public and that was user-friendly. After he released his browser, Mosaic,
                        within nine months, one million people had downloaded the Mosaic web browser and were actively
                        using it. This caught the attention of a wealthy tech investor, James Clark. James Clark knew
                        that with the incredible reach Mark’s web browser had, it could be a worthwhile investment.
                        James Clark gave Mark a business proposition and offered him a full-time job in order to
                        monetize Mosaic. Mark, who hadn’t even graduated from college at the time, took the offer which
                        soon began the browser wars.

                    <li>Netscape, the company that was funding the browser was growing rapidly. This sparked Microsoft’s
                        curiosity. Microsoft, at the time, being the company that had a monopoly over the operating
                        system almost every single computer used, began to feel threatened. Bill Gates was notorious for
                        destroying any company that posed a threat to his empire. Netscape later released its Navigator
                        Browser and that’s when Microsoft began its sketchy practices. The Navigator Browser was an
                        instant success and Microsoft wanted to put an end to that. Microsoft and Netscape had a meeting
                        and offered Netscape a one-time fee of one million dollars for access to all of their
                        technologies.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Netscape obviously said no, and Bill Gates sent out a memo to his employees that
                        they were basically going to copy Netscape and drive them out of business. One of Microsoft
                        Sketchy tactics was sending its so-called secret salesman to these large companies that used
                        computers running the Microsoft operating system. They then came up with terms that simply said,
                        if they were to download and use Netscape Browser, their Microsoft licenses would be revoked.
                        Businesses could not give up using Microsoft because it was basically the only Operating System
                        available
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Netscape went public on Wall Street, and James Clark said his initial investment of five million
                        dollars turned into about 600 million dollars. Netscape at this point felt extremely powerful,
                        Mark Andreessen even geekily insulted Microsoft.

                    <li>
                        Microsoft went on to release its own browser called Internet Explorer and offered it for free,
                        which was a game-changer in the browser wars. Netscape was charging people to download its
                        browser. Microsoft having billions of dollars in revenue decided to take a small financial loss
                        by offering its web browser for free, and ultimately drove Netscape out of business. This led
                        the United States Government to file an antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft and was ultimately
                        found guilty, forcing Microsoft to break into two companies. Unfortunately, it was too late and
                        Netscape was ceased to exist. Soon after the Federal Appeals court determined the verdict was
                        too harsh and rescinded the order to split the company in two.
