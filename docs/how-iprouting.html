                    <li> A computer’s address is referred to as the IP Address, short for Internet Protocol Addresses.
                        IP addresses are a string of digits, similar to a phone number, and they allow devices to
                        communicate with each other. Original IP addresses used Internet Protocol version4, or IPv4,
                        which defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. This allowed for around 4 billion unique IP
                        addresses. However, the Internet grew in popularity and there was a need for more IP addresses.
                        To fix this solution, a new version called IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, now uses 128
                        bits for the IP address. This allows for around 340 undecillion unique addresses. To put this
                        into perspective, this is enough IP addresses for every grain of sand on earth.

                <ul>

                    <li>Packets refer to the way IP addresses communicate with each other. Because most data exchange on
                        the Internet consists of large files, the data is sent in separate parts called packets. These
                        packets can be thought of as cars that can transport different objects. Like cars, packets can
                        also transfer different types of files, such as music, e-book, and video files. Furthermore,
                        most files are too large to fit into one packet. Instead, files are divided up and sent
                        separately in packets. To illustrate this concept, imagine transporting a space shuttle by
                        taking it apart and putting into separate trucks to transport it to a certain location. The
                        trucks in this scenario would represent what packets are to data.

                <ul>

                    <li>Data also doesn’t travel directly to its designated location. Instead, data travels in different
                        paths, much like how cars may sometimes take different roads to reach the same destination.
                        Moreover, the packets of the data can also take different paths to reach the same address. The
                        path the data takes is usually the cheapest available path. In this case, cheapest does not
                        necessarily mean cost but rather refers to the time, politics, and relationships between
                        companies.

                    <br>
                    <li>One important thing to know is that because packets can take multiple different routes to get to
                        a certain address, this makes the Internet more reliable because it is fault tolerant. Fault
                        tolerant means that in case one path is interrupted, there are many other paths that allow the
                        data to be transmitted.

                <ul>

                    <li>Domain Name System, commonly known as DNS, is the system in which a domain name like
                        www.example.com is given an IP address like, 190.63.184.142. When you want to go to example.com,
                        your computer requests the IP address of example.com from a DNS server. If that DNS server
                        doesn’t know the IP address of example.com, then it’ll communicate with other DNS servers until
                        the IP address can be returned to your computer. This way your computer can communicate with
                        example.com. Since one DNS server can’t possibly contain all IP addresses, it is split up
                        between many DNS servers, some of which only handle .org, or .com, or .edu domain names. The
                        Domain Name System was created to be an open and public communication protocol, for governments
                        and educational institutions. But this openness has its downside. A DNS server can be hacked,
                        and be made to return a different IP address for a certain domain, this is called DNS spoofing.
                        Instead of going to the real google.com, DNS spoofing can send you to a mockup of google and you
                        can become vulnerable by thinking a fake website is actually real.
